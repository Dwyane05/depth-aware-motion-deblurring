A lot of pictures are taken with a mobile phone or a hand-held camera. Blur
caused by shaking of the camera during the exposure is a widely spread
problem. In particular this blur occurs when the camera moves during long
exposure time such as in scenes with ambient illumination. All pixels in the
taken picture are affected by this blur. In an image of a planar scene blurred
by camera motion parallel to the scene this
blur is the same for each pixel. But scenes with different objects as shown in
figure :ref:`tsu-image` yield different depths. Figure :ref:`tsu-gt` shows
the different depth layers being regions of nearly constant depth. In the case of
translational camera movement a near point is blurred more than a distant one.
So each depth layer has
its own blur kernel called spatially-variant blur.

The deblurring of these images is still an ongoing research issue. There are
several approaches for removing blur from an image of a planar scene but less
algorithms to remove spatially-variant blur caused by translational camera movement
while photographing a scene with depth variations. However the latter is interesting
because most scenes have depth variations. It is hard to correctly deblur a
depth scene without any depth information. Stereo image pairs can provide such
information through stereo matching. Furthermore the necessary hardware to
obtain stereo image pairs (stereo camera) is more and more available â€“ even in
mobile phones. [#]_

Even with the depth information deblurring of scenes with depth variations is
not easy. Small-size regions lack necessary structural information for the
blur kernel estimation. An approach to overcome this problem is presented in
the paper from Xu and Jia :cite:`Xu2012`. They provide an iterative algorithm
for motion deblurring with stereo images. It uses one Point Spread Function (PSF)
per depth layer to deblur the image on each depth level. They overcome
the challenge for estimating the PSF in small-size regions with a hierarchical
approach named region tree to guide this estimation.

This study thesis provides a reference implementation of this depth-aware
motion deblurring algorithm from Xu and Jia. After a theoretical introduction
to deblurring this algorithm is presented in detail. We will focus on
the challenges that have to be solved to be able to deblur an image of a scene
with depth variations.
