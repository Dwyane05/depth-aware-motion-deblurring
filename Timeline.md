## open tasks so far

cannot finsih this project in time -> new date for hand-in: 21.04.16 (?)

### issues

- two-phase kernel estimation: error in kernel est. and no second phase -> we have no reliable top-level PSFs -> use work-around
- mid-level psf estimation: initial psf est. for child and psf selection not checked
- image restoration: brightness issues with spatial deconv


### evaluating

- run algorithm on different settings & write down results


### finish writing study thesis

- write out introduction, theory, description, eva and conclusion in full


## extended weeks

- Week 20 (14.03.): mid-level psf estimation (initial est.)
- Week 21 (21.03.): mid-level psf estimation (psf selection)
- Week 22 (28.03.): two-phase kernel estimation (phase one)
- Week 23 (04.04.): two-phase kernel estimation (phase two)
- Week 24 (11.04.): eval
- Week 24 (18.04.): writing study thesis



### Afterwards: preparation of presentation

- make nice presentation

Afterwards: two-phase kernel estimation fix
